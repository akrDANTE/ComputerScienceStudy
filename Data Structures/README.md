### All About Data Structures

# What are Data Structures?

Data is information that has been translated into form that is efficient for movement or processing.
Data is information converted into digital binary format(0s and 1s). In computer memory it is represented by state of transistors(on or off). To computers everything is 1's and 0's, it's our job to program computers so they can interpret data in more useful representations. That is where data types come in.

Data types help computer to know what the bits represent. Primary/primitive or fundamental data types in C language are :
int, char, float, double etc..
These represent integers, characters, real numbers respectively.

Now data structures are collection of primary/primitive data or some structure of these data types. Data structures define how this data is organised in the memory for helping in efficiently solving problems.
A data structure is used to store, organise, process and retreive data.

## Types of Data Structures

### i) Linear and Non linear

            * Linear involves structures like array, linked list, stack, queue
            * Non Linear involves structures like tree, graph, trie etc.

### ii) Static and dynamic

            * Static data structures remain of same size.
            * Dynamic data structures can grow on demand.

### iii) Homogenous and non-homogeneous

            * Homogenous data structures contain elements of same type.
            * Non homogeneous contain elements of multiple types.
